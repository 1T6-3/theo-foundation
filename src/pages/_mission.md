The Theo Foundation was founded in 2019 driven with the passion to support people with Drugs abuse after effects, mental illnesses, those recovering from sexual violence and epileptic groups. Why? These are the least listened to voices in society today. The foundation is here to amplify theses voices and help ease the pain.

The purpose of the target groups were majority because plenty of people today are silently going through sexual violence, mental illnesses and epileptic cases. The silence is proudly sponsored by stigma. All these affect individual productivity at work, home and in society.

The Theo foundation brings together a group of physicians, therapists, social workers, and nurses with the training to bring out the best in our patients. The foundation priorities are patient-centered and specific rehabilitation goals have been formulated to reflect the patientâ€™s needs and desires. The primary care physicians can also make appropriate referrals for all that is needed.
