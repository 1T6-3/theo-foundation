## How we work

### Vagus nerve stimulator

Vagus nerve stimulation involves the use of a device to stimulate the vagus nerve with electrical impulses. An implantable vagus nerve stimulator is currently FDA-approved to treat epilepsy and depression. We have managed to impact over 30 young people using this method to fight depression, manage epilepsy and restore their participation abilities in society.

### Surgery at Butabika Hospital

Through multidisciplinary approach to healthcare, Butabika Hospital provides access to a wide variety of medical specialties for a full range of clinical services, as well as primary care. We have had a number of successful surgeries and great recoveries.

### Community participation

We strongly advocate for community participation among individuals/ patients. Their involvement in community events, religious gatherings, volunteering and others reduce on the loneliness and exposes them to possibilities. This approach is strongly recommended by the foundation.

### The Hospital to Home journey

Some patients require continued rehabilitation whether more intensive as found in acute rehabilitation centers or lower acuity provided in nursing facilities skilled in post-acute care. We walk with the patients every step of the way according to their required attention.
