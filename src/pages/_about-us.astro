      <h4>Vagus nerve stimulator</h4>
      <p>
        Vagus nerve stimulation involves the use of a device to stimulate the
        vagus nerve with electrical impulses. An implantable vagus nerve
        stimulator is currently FDA-approved to treat epilepsy and depression.
        We have managed to impact over 30 young people using this method to
        fight depression, manage epilepsy and restore their participation
        abilities in society.

      <h4>Surgery at Butabika Hospital</h4>
      <p>
        Through multidisciplinary approach to healthcare, Butabika Hospital
        provides access to a wide variety of medical specialties for a full
        range of clinical services, as well as primary care. We have had a
        number of successful surgeries and great recoveries.
      </p>

      <h4>Community participation</h4>
      <p>
        We strongly advocate for community participation among individuals/
        patients. Their involvement in community events, religious gatherings,
        volunteering and others reduce on the loneliness and exposes them to
        possibilities. This approach is strongly recommended by the foundation.
      </p>

      <h4>The Hospital to Home journey</h4>
      <p>
        Some patients require continued rehabilitation whether more intensive as
        found in acuteÂ rehabilitation centers or lower acuity provided in
        nursing facilities skilled in post-acute care. We walk with the patients
        every step of the way according to their required attention.
